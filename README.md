## Overview

This document outlines the collision detection system implemented in the 3D maze application using Three.js within a Next.js framework. The application uses axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) to detect collisions between the player character and maze walls, preventing the player from walking through solid objects.

## Implementation Details

### Collision System Components

The collision detection system consists of three main components:

1. **Wall Bounding Boxes**: Created when the maze walls are initialized
2. **Player Bounding Box**: Generated dynamically based on player position
3. **Collision Check Function**: Detects intersections between these bounding boxes

### Code Implementation

### 1. Wall Bounding Box Creation

When walls are created in the `createMaze()` function, each wall has a bounding box calculated and stored in its `userData` property:

```jsx
// Create bounding box for collision detection
wall.userData.bbox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(wall);

wallsRef.current.push(wall);
sceneRef.current.add(wall);

```

### 2. Player Bounding Box Creation

A player bounding box is created dynamically during the collision check based on the current or proposed position:

```jsx
const playerBBox = new THREE.Box3(
  new THREE.Vector3(
    position.x - 0.3,
    position.y - playerRef.current.height,
    position.z - 0.3
  ),
  new THREE.Vector3(
    position.x + 0.3,
    position.y,
    position.z + 0.3
  )
);

```

This creates a box around the player with dimensions of 0.6 units wide, 0.6 units deep, and a height based on the player's height value.

### 3. Collision Detection Function

The `checkWallCollisions()` function performs the actual collision detection:

```jsx
const checkWallCollisions = (position) => {
  const playerBBox = new THREE.Box3(
    new THREE.Vector3(
      position.x - 0.3,
      position.y - playerRef.current.height,
      position.z - 0.3
    ),
    new THREE.Vector3(
      position.x + 0.3,
      position.y,
      position.z + 0.3
    )
  );

  for (const wall of wallsRef.current) {
    if (playerBBox.intersectsBox(wall.userData.bbox)) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
};

```

This function:

- Creates a bounding box representing the player at the given position
- Checks for intersection with each wall's bounding box
- Returns `true` if any intersection is found, otherwise `false`

### 4. Movement Handling with Collision

In the animation loop, the collision detection is used to prevent movement into walls:

```jsx
// Calculate new position with collision detection
const newPosition = cameraRef.current.position.clone().add(playerRef.current.velocity);

// Check if the new position would cause a collision
if (!checkWallCollisions(newPosition)) {
  cameraRef.current.position.copy(newPosition);
}

```

This code:

1. Calculates a potential new position based on the current velocity
2. Checks if this new position would cause a collision
3. Only updates the position if no collision is detected

## Next.js Integration

### Why Next.js?

Next.js is used as the application framework for several compelling reasons:

1. **Client-side Rendering for Interactive 3D**:
The ThreeMaze component leverages Next.js's efficient client-side rendering capabilities, which are essential for real-time 3D graphics and interactions.
2. **React Component Architecture**:
Next.js provides a React-based component structure that helps organize the 3D application's codebase, separating concerns like rendering, state management, and user input.
3. **useEffect and useRef Hooks**:
React's hooks, particularly `useEffect` for lifecycle management and `useRef` for maintaining references across renders, are crucial for managing Three.js instances.
4. **Code Splitting and Optimization**:
Next.js's built-in code splitting ensures that Three.js libraries (which can be large) are only loaded when needed, improving initial load times.
5. **Fast Refresh**:
During development, Next.js's Fast Refresh feature enables quick iterations when modifying 3D code without losing component state.
6. **Deployment Optimization**:
Next.js provides excellent build optimization, reducing bundle sizes and improving load performance for users.
7. **Potential for Server Components**:
While this component is client-side, Next.js's server components could be used for other parts of the application, such as generating maze layouts server-side.

### Implementation Details

The Three.js maze is implemented as a React component within the Next.js framework:

```jsx
const ThreeMaze = () => {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  // Other refs and state...

  useEffect(() => {
    // Three.js initialization logic
    // Only runs on client-side

    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      // Cleanup logic
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen relative">
      <div ref={containerRef} className="w-full h-full"></div>
      {/* Instructions UI */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ThreeMaze;

```

### Client-Side Rendering Considerations

Since Three.js requires access to the DOM and browser APIs, special considerations are needed for Next.js:

1. **Dynamic Imports**:
Three.js should be imported dynamically to ensure it's only loaded client-side:

```jsx
// Example of dynamically importing Three.js in Next.js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const ThreeMazeWithNoSSR = dynamic(
  () => import('../components/ThreeMaze'),
  { ssr: false }
);

```

1. **Conditional Execution**:
Three.js code must only execute in browser environments:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    // Three.js code here
  }
}, []);

```

1. **Module Augmentation**:
For TypeScript projects, module augmentation may be needed for Three.js types.

## Challenges and Limitations

### 1. Rigid Collision Response

The current implementation has a binary collision response - either the player can move to the new position or cannot move at all. This can lead to:

- "Sticky" walls where the player gets completely stopped
- Inability to slide along walls when only one component of movement would cause a collision
- Potential for the player to get stuck in corners

### 2. Fixed Bounding Box Size

The player bounding box has a fixed size:

- Width and depth of 0.6 units (Â±0.3 from center)
- Height based on `playerRef.current.height`

This doesn't account for:

- Different player states (crouching, etc.)
- Camera rotation affecting the perceived player width

### 3. Performance Considerations

For each frame and each potential movement:

- A new player bounding box is created
- Intersection tests are run against all walls

For larger mazes with many walls, this could become a performance bottleneck.

### 4. Lack of Debugging Visualization

The current implementation doesn't provide visual feedback about bounding boxes, making it difficult to debug collision issues.

### 5. Next.js Specific Challenges

- **Hydration Mismatch**: Preventing hydration mismatches between server and client rendering with Three.js
- **Canvas Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of Three.js resources during component unmounting
- **Bundle Size**: Managing the impact of Three.js on application bundle size

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Sliding Collision Response

Implement a sliding collision response that decomposes movement and allows the player to slide along walls:

```jsx
const handleCollisions = (position, velocity) => {
  // Try moving on X axis only
  const xMovement = new THREE.Vector3(velocity.x, 0, 0);
  const newPositionX = position.clone().add(xMovement);
  if (!checkWallCollisions(newPositionX)) {
    position.copy(newPositionX);
  }

  // Try moving on Z axis only
  const zMovement = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, velocity.z);
  const newPositionZ = position.clone().add(zMovement);
  if (!checkWallCollisions(newPositionZ)) {
    position.copy(newPositionZ);
  }

  return position;
};

```

### 2. Dynamic Bounding Box Updates

For moving or resizing objects, bounding boxes should be updated:

```jsx
// Update wall bounding boxes if walls can move
const updateBoundingBoxes = () => {
  for (const wall of wallsRef.current) {
    wall.userData.bbox.setFromObject(wall);
  }
};

```

### 3. Spatial Partitioning

For large mazes, implement spatial partitioning to reduce the number of collision checks:

```jsx
// Create a simple grid-based spatial partitioning system
const gridSize = 10;
const spatialGrid = {};

const addToSpatialGrid = (object) => {
  const gridX = Math.floor(object.position.x / gridSize);
  const gridZ = Math.floor(object.position.z / gridSize);
  const key = `${gridX},${gridZ}`;

  if (!spatialGrid[key]) {
    spatialGrid[key] = [];
  }

  spatialGrid[key].push(object);
};

const getObjectsInProximity = (position) => {
  const gridX = Math.floor(position.x / gridSize);
  const gridZ = Math.floor(position.z / gridSize);
  const nearby = [];

  // Check neighboring cells too
  for (let x = gridX - 1; x <= gridX + 1; x++) {
    for (let z = gridZ - 1; z <= gridZ + 1; z++) {
      const key = `${x},${z}`;
      if (spatialGrid[key]) {
        nearby.push(...spatialGrid[key]);
      }
    }
  }

  return nearby;
};

```

### 4. Debug Visualization

Add visual representations of bounding boxes for debugging:

```jsx
const debugMode = false;
const debugHelpers = [];

const createDebugBoundingBox = (bbox, color = 0xff0000) => {
  const helper = new THREE.Box3Helper(bbox, new THREE.Color(color));
  debugHelpers.push(helper);
  sceneRef.current.add(helper);
};

// In animation loop
if (debugMode) {
  // Remove old helpers
  debugHelpers.forEach(helper => sceneRef.current.remove(helper));
  debugHelpers.length = 0;

  // Add player bounding box helper
  const playerBBox = new THREE.Box3(/* ... */);
  createDebugBoundingBox(playerBBox, 0x00ff00);

  // Add wall bounding box helpers
  wallsRef.current.forEach(wall => {
    createDebugBoundingBox(wall.userData.bbox);
  });
}

```

### 5. Next.js Performance Optimizations

```jsx
// Example of optimizing Three.js imports in Next.js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Only import what's needed from Three.js
const ThreeCore = dynamic(() =>
  import('../components/ThreeCore').then(mod => mod.default),
  { ssr: false }
);

// Implement page route component
const MazePage = () => (
  <div className="game-container">
    <ThreeCore />
    <GameUI />
  </div>
);

```
